# NCD Comm

This library provides the basic communication classes used by the ncd-red-* modules for ncd.io devices. You generally should not need to install this library, as it will be included as a dependency by other libraries as needed.

When using Node-Red, this library provides a configuration node to supply I2C communication to the other NCD nodes.
